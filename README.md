Here are the materials is used.

- Arduino Nano (you use any small Arduino or ESP32)
- [NeoPixel Strip](https://www.amazon.ca/CHINLY-Individually-Addressable-Waterproof-waterproof/dp/B01LSF4QDM) - Use some water proofed once
- [Small Power Booster](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/32891706812.html)
- [Cables](https://www.amazon.ca/Elegoo-120pcs-Multicolored-Breadboard-arduino/dp/B01EV70C78/)
- [Ble Modul (optional)](https://www.amazon.ca/DSD-TECH-SH-HC-08-Transceiver-Compatible/dp/B01N4P7T0H)
- [LiPO USB Charger (optional)](https://www.amazon.ca/Lithium-Overcharge-Over-Discharge-Over-Current-Protection/dp/B07KYGL71L/)
- [Battery 500maH](https://www.amazon.ca/Fytoo-500mAh-Battery-battery-Charger/dp/B0794ZPVSX/)
- [1 Diffused NeoPixel 8mm](https://www.amazon.ca/EDGELEC-Tri-Color-Multicolor-Resistors-Included/dp/B077X95LRZ/) (optional)
- [Some heat shrink](https://www.amazon.ca/Yosawa-Pieces-Heat-Shrink-Tubing/dp/B07SPRNMD5)
- [Christmas Hat](https://www.amazon.ca/Confortable-Velvet-Christmas-Favors-Adults/dp/B07G44K67L)
- [You may also want to add Capacitor , Diode and resistor](https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/mlc-downloads/downloads/submissions/64467/versions/2/previews/html/NeoPixelExample_Basic.html) to be proper

Of course we will need some soldering iron and tools.

You can find these parts on the internet at various place like AliExpress or Amazon etc.
